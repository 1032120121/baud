# baud.ai

BAUD is a distributed graph database. 

## Data Model

Attribute, Entity, Association, Category, Space, Graph

all the entities (maybe in different categories) in one space share the same 'partition key'. 

each entity has an internal 'Object ID' (OID) generated by the system, which is unique aross the entire graph. 

any attribute can be indexed and morever fulltext search is a first-class citizen. 

## Cluster Management
