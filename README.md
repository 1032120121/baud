BAUD is a distributed document-graph database


## Concepts

Entity/Document, Edge/Association, Space, DB/Graph

all the entities in one space usually have the same set of fields. 

each entity has an internal 'Unique ID' (UID) generated by the system, which is unique aross the entire graph. 

any attribute can be indexed and morever fulltext search is a first-class citizen.

## Partitioning

db -> space -> partition -> slot

partition = slot id range
