BAUD is a document-graph database, i.e., a storage & computing system for documents and graphs. 

## Data Model

Entity, Edge/Association, Space(entity or edge), DB/Graph

each entity has an internal 'Unique ID' (UID) generated by the system, which is unique aross the entire graph. 

Entities as documents: UID -> JSON. 

Edges as documents: (UIDi, UIDj) -> JSON.

any attribute of entities or edges can be indexed and morever full-text search is a first-class citizen. 

## Partitioning

db -> entity or edge space -> partition -> slot

partition = slot id range

## Components

router, partitionserver, master

the master is HA via raft replication. 

3 or more partitionservers form a replication group by means of raft. 

partition re-sharding is implemented through async filtered replication. 

multiple partitions of different spaces could be co-located on the same replicated partitionserver group. 

## Cluster Management

conainer-native - baud runs on Kubernetes clusters
