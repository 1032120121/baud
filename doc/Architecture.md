# Architecture

BaudEngine (Baud for short) is a distributed data serving system for elastic storage & intelligent search.

## Data Model

Field, Entity, Concept, Edge, Space, DB

Each entity has an internal 'Unique ID' (UID) generated by the system, which is unique aross the entire system. 

Entities as documents: UID -> Fields

Entity -instanceOf-> Concept -subclassOf-> Concept ...

Edges as documents: (UIDi, UIDj) -> Fields

Field: name -> a typed value or a sorted array of values

Any field of entities or edges can be indexed and morever full-text search is a first-class citizen. 


## Overview

### components

master, raft replication for high availability

partitionserver (ps)

router


### cluster management

conainer-native - baud runs on Kubernetes clusters

### partitioning

db -> entity or edge space -> partition -> slot

partition = slot id range

3 or more partitionservers form a replication group by means of raft. 

partition re-sharding is implemented through async filtered replication. 

multiple partitions of different spaces of the same db could be co-located on the same ps repl group.

### scalability guarantee

One Baud cluster can host one to thousands of databases; 
one DB can host one to millions of spaces;
one space can host one to billions of objects;

## Master

three/five/.. BM instances form a replicated BM service, or leverage a distributed coordination service like etcd/consul to store the metadata of Baud itself. 

we currently choose the former approach. 

* e.g. Start a master via cmd shell,

host2:$ baud -cm -http-addr host2:5001 -raft-addr host2:5002 -topo http://host1:5001 -data ~/node


### data structures

* database metadata

db (name -> id)

space (name -> id): entity or edge

partition (slot id range of (source) entity uid) : entity or edge

* cluster topo metadata

master nodes

ps nodes

router nodes

### persistence

marshalled and written to boltdb

### key operations

* Create a Space

foreach partition among the space, select a destination PS raft group (PSRG) to create the partition.

* Split a Partition

1, select two PSRG as the destinations

2, call the two raft leaders to setup async filtered replication with the original to-be-splitted partition leader

3, replicate

4, cutover

* Merge Partitions

the reverse process of split

* Migrate a Partition

based on the async replication between dest and source. 

* PS metrics reporting

* Router metrics reporting


## PS

Several PS nodes form a raft group, partitionserver group (PSG). And one PSG usualy serves a partition - a part of entity or edge space. 

### Kernel - inside a partition

* storage

for entity partition, (UID, fieldID) -> a single or multiple packed values of the field

for edge partition, (<UID1, UID2>, fieldID) -> ...

* search 

TODOï¼šin-memory indexing, based on our own data structures


### Key Operations


## Router

## Search

### Ranking

## Manageability

Ops Center

Dashboard

### Monitoring

cluster-level statistics

space-level info

individual nodes

GC

SlowLog

### Deployment and Configration


### Upgrade


## Applications

### document databases

### search engine

### social backend

email

messaging

blogging

### object storage metadata

buckets as spaces

object URL is indexed properly

### CFS metadata

a filesystem namespace as a baud space

an inode as an object with link (parentIno + "-" + name) as an indexing field (array)
